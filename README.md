# Sun Life Campus
## Inspiration
Recognizing that traditional financial literacy tools can often be too intimidating or boring, we were inspired to gamify them to create a more engaging and appealing financial instrument, especially for the modern youths of this new generation. The case study provided by SunLife further intrigued us to explore the digital services and tools that industry-leading businesses in the finance sector, which we then developed through the use of AI models to enhance user engagement and accessibility.

## What it does
Sun Life Campus enables users to track their insurance coverage and financial statistics, as well as create engaging, specific, unique, and smart goals through the use of generative AI models. Implementing a video-game-esque interface to further user engagement, users can collect in-game currency through the progression of their financial goals, which then enables users to redeem the currency for various rewards in a virtual shop.

## How we built it
Using Next.JS, React, Typescript, and Tailwind for the front end, we connected the backend through a Restful API client into an AI model from OpenAI, storing data using MongoDB, and hosting the app through AWS.

## Challenges we ran into
Understanding how a project setup using Next.JS and Typescript functioned differently from native ReactJS and Node.JS, as well as working to understand how to develop a Restful API to connect the project between the backend and database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Completing the project while learning new technologies many of us were unfamiliar with while developing unique and innovative solutions to the problems that we came across along the way.

## What we learned
How to set up databases and hosting through AWS, as well as how to make use of OpenAI to integrate an AI chatbot that is connected throughout the application.

## What's next for Sun Life Campus
Sun Life Campus plans to further refine its AI language model, as well as expand its database. In the future, we hope to revamp the design as well to further improve intuitiveness and accessibility.
